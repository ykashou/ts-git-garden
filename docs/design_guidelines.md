# Personal GitHub Portfolio Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from GitHub's profile pages and developer portfolios, emphasizing minimal aesthetic and excellent readability while incorporating a creative "garden of projects" exploration theme.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette (Arcane Blue Theme)
- **Primary**: 240 100% 85% (soft blue)
- **Secondary**: 240 30% 25% (dark blue-gray)
- **Background**: 240 15% 8% (very dark blue-gray)
- **Surface**: 240 20% 12% (dark surface)
- **Text Primary**: 240 10% 90% (light gray-blue)
- **Text Secondary**: 240 15% 70% (medium gray-blue)
- **Accent**: 200 100% 70% (cyan highlight)

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Poppins (Google Fonts)
- **Headings**: Poppins 600-700 weight
- **Body Text**: Poppins 400-500 weight
- **Code/Technical**: Poppins 400 weight

### Layout System
- **Spacing Units**: Tailwind spacing of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 (consistent 0.25rem increments)
- **Border Radius**: 0.8rem consistently across all cards and components
- **Grid System**: Responsive grid with 1-2-3 column layout (mobile-tablet-desktop)

### Component Library

**Navigation**
- Simple horizontal navigation with smooth transitions between portfolio and research papers sections
- Subtle hover states with Arcane Blue accent colors

**Project Cards**
- Card-based layout with 0.8rem border radius
- Garden-themed visual metaphors (growth, cultivation, exploration)
- Tech stack badges with rounded corners
- Hover effects with subtle lift and glow

**Research Papers Section**
- Clean academic formatting
- Publication date prominence
- External link indicators
- Abstract previews with expand functionality

**Bitcoin Donation Component**
- QR code display with elegant framing
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Wallet address display with monospace styling

**About Section**
- Personal introduction with garden metaphor integration
- Skills showcase as "cultivated abilities"
- Contact information subtly integrated

## Garden Theme Integration
- Use botanical metaphors for project descriptions ("growing," "cultivating," "blooming")
- Organic flowing layouts rather than rigid grids
- Subtle growth-inspired animations (very minimal)
- Projects presented as "specimens" in the digital garden

## Images
**No large hero image required**. The design relies on:
- Small decorative icons and project thumbnails
- Bitcoin QR code (functional, not decorative)
- Subtle background patterns or gradients
- Project screenshot previews in cards

## Key Design Principles
- **Minimalism**: Clean, uncluttered layouts with generous whitespace
- **Readability**: High contrast text on Arcane Blue backgrounds
- **Exploration**: Encourage discovery through intuitive navigation
- **Professional**: Maintain credibility while being creative
- **GitHub-Native**: Feels natural within GitHub's ecosystem

## Responsive Behavior
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Single column on mobile, expanding to multi-column on larger screens
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Readable typography at all screen sizes
