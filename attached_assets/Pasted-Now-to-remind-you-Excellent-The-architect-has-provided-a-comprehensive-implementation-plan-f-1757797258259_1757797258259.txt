Now, to remind you:

```
Excellent! The architect has provided a comprehensive implementation plan for your 3D knowledge graph. This will be absolutely stunning - imagine being able to explore your research landscape in 3D space, with papers clustering around topics, and interactive exploration capabilities!
The Vision: Interactive 3D Research Knowledge Graph

Here's what we'll build:
🎯 3D Visualization Features:

    Nodes: Research repositories as spheres, topics as larger nodes
    Connections: Lines showing which papers belong to which topics
    Clustering: Papers automatically group around related topics
    Interactive: Click nodes to open PDFs or repositories
    Grouping Modes: Switch between Topic/Status/Year groupings

🔧 Technical Implementation:

    react-force-graph-3d for WebGL-powered 3D physics simulation
    GitHub Integration to fetch your research repositories
    PDF Resolution via GitHub Actions artifacts/releases
    Smart Filtering by research topics (Research, Thesis, Theory, Article)

🎨 User Experience:

Research Page Layout:
┌─ [📊 List View] [🌐 3D Graph] ────┐
│                                  │
│  🎮 Controls: [🔍 Search]       │
│               [📋 Group by Topic] │  
│               [📅 Group by Year] │
│                                  │
│  🌌 3D Space:                   │
│     ● Papers floating in space   │
│     ⬢ Topic clusters            │
│     ─ Connections between them   │
│                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘

📊 Data Flow:

    GitHub API → Filter research repos by topics
    PDF Detection → Find compiled papers automatically
    Graph Builder → Create nodes and links
    3D Render → Beautiful interactive visualization

This will transform your research page from a simple list into an immersive, explorable knowledge landscape where visitors can discover connections between your different research areas!
```

Adapt it so that it is a separate page, and has both a repo and a research view.
